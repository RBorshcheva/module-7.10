                <p>Hash Table Solution for Python Two Sum Interview Problem
                    The approach that is most likely to impress your interviewer is to use a hash table. In Python this generally just means using a dictionary. The basic idea is that we loop through our input looking up the compliment of the current value (target - current_value) in a hash table. If it is found, we are done. Otherwise, we store the values in the hash table along with the indices where those values were found.
                    
                    Key observation: the hash table stores value: index pairs, with the current input value as the key and the index as the entry for that key.
                    
                    Here is the code listing for a hash table based solution to the Two Sum interview problem in Python. As hash tables are generally very efficient data structures for performing lookups, this solution is very time-efficient (basically O(n) time complexity).
                    
                    Depending on your level of experience, you may want to try to implement the solution for yourself. If so, here's a stub and some tests to get you started. My solution is shown below.</p>
