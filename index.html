                <p>Hash Table Solution for Python Two Sum Interview Problem
                    The approach that is most likely to impress your interviewer is to use a hash table. In Python this generally just means using a dictionary. The basic idea is that we loop through our input looking up the compliment of the current value (target - current_value) in a hash table. If it is found, we are done. Otherwise, we store the values in the hash table along with the indices where those values were found.
                    
                    Key observation: the hash table stores value: index pairs, with the current input value as the key and the index as the entry for that key.
                    
                    Here is the code listing for a hash table based solution to the Two Sum interview problem in Python. As hash tables are generally very efficient data structures for performing lookups, this solution is very time-efficient (basically O(n) time complexity).
                    
                    Depending on your level of experience, you may want to try to implement the solution for yourself. If so, here's a stub and some tests to get you started. My solution is shown below.</p>

                <p>NoSQL databases are becoming more and more popular these days. 
                    This is because companies increasingly require NoSQL databases as traditional relational databases are not enough to fulfill their requirements anymore. 
                    Now companies have to deal with millions of users at the same time, handle insane quantities of both structured and unstructured data daily, and make sure there are no interruptions in their services. All these expectations have given rise to the NoSQL databases that are more agile, scalable, and also better suited to unprecedented levels of big data. That is why this article specifies the Top 10 Open-Source NoSQL Databases that you can use as per your specific requirements.</p>
